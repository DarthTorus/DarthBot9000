    "description":"• Attack Flies are Red and Black flashing flies that will follow Isaac relentlessly until killed. Their only way of damaging Isaac is by contact, and they move rather slowly, making them easy to kill. However, they can be dangerous when found in groups, as they can swarm around Isaac quickly.\n\n• Attack Flies turn into regular Flies if Isaac has Skatole. However, they take a small amount of time to convert into Flies, so it is possible for Isaac to be damaged if the player is not careful.",
