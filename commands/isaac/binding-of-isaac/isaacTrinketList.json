      "description": "• Spawns one coin of any type upon taking damage.\n• Swallowed Penny can also be found by destroying urns and special shopkeepers.\n• Though similar to the Piggy Bank item, the Swallowed Penny is not limited to just pennies.\n• Added in Afterbirth Unlike Piggy Bank, playing as Keeper with this trinket always drops a coin, allowing semi-infinite life.\n• A trick for farming money when playing as Keeper is to find a room with some static hazard like spikes and taking damage, causing a coin to appear. A penny will only refill life while a nickel will give four cents, and a dime will give nine cents.\n• This trick can also be used to survive multiple uses of a sacrifice room, healing with the dropped coin between each sacrifice.",
